Spatio-temporal assessment of the European hake (Merluccius merluccius) recruits in the northern Iberian Peninsula

In this repository we present the R code from the model in our manuscript at Frontiers in Marine Science. It is a Bayesian spatio-temporal hurdle model via INLA for European hake recruits, where the response variables are probability of occurrence (Binomial) and conditional to presence abundance (Gamma). No exploratory analysis neither figures R code are included.

Scripts:

0) Spatio-temporal structure selection (Paradinas et al,. 2017)
1) Environmental covariates selection
2) Inla.group for selected environmental covariates 
3) Final selected spatio-temporal model
4) Prediction by components from Iosu Paradinas

It is worth to mention that prediction step with INLA can be done through different ways. In our case, we performed manually the prediction by taking samples of the posterior distribution for all the components within the linear predictor and applying the correspondent des-transform functions for the Binomial and Gamma likelihoods. However, prediction through a pred.stack or the alternative inla.posterior.sample (cheaper computational cost) may be more accurate.
